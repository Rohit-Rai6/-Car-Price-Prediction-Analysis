# -Car-Price-Prediction-Analysis

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Jupyter Notebook.

Description: Developed a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, engine size, and more.

Method:
Conducted data preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Built and tuned regression models using Ridge and Lasso regularization with cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters.
Evaluated model performance using mean squared error and adjusted hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

Achievements/Results:
Achieved a mean squared error of X on the test set, demonstrating the model's accuracy in predicting car prices.
Successfully implemented regularization techniques that improved model performance by Y%.
